\paragraph{Calculation of GDP}
There are 3 definitions of GDP, each corresponding to a way to calculate it.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item GDP is the market value of the \textbf{final} goods and services produced \textbf{in the economy} during a given period.
    \item[-] Intermediate goods and services are not considered in this way of calculation.
    \item[-] Foreign producers' production within the economy is counted into this economy's GDP.
    
    \item GDP is the sum of \textbf{value added} in the economy during a given period.
    \item[-] Value added $=$ Value of production $-$ Value of intermediate goods used in production.

    \item GDP is the sum of \textbf{incomes} in the economy during a given period.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
    Carl's Computer Center sells computers to business firms. Businesses then use the computers to produce other goods and services. Over the past year, sales representatives were paid \$3.5 million, \$0.5 million went for rent on the building, \$0.5 million went for taxes, \$0.5 million was profit for Carl, and \$10 million was paid for computers at the wholesale level. What was the firm's total contribution to GDP?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Pete the Pizza Man produced \$87,000 worth of pizzas in the past year. He paid \$39,000 to employees, paid \$11,000 for vegetables and other ingredients, and paid \$5000 in taxes. He began the year with ingredient inventories valued at \$1000, and ended the year with inventories valued at \$2000. What was Pete's (and his employees') total contribution to GDP this year?
\end{exercise}
